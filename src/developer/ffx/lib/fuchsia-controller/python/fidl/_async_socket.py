    """Represents an async socket.

    In 99% of cases it is recommended to use this instead of the standard fuchsia-controller Socket
    object. This has built-in support for handling waits.

    In the remaining 1% of cases it may be useful for the user to do a one-off attempt at reading a
    socket directly and immediately exiting in the event that ZX_ERR_SHOULD_WAIT is encountered.
    Such a case would likely involve adding some custom behavior to existing async code, like
    registering custom wakers. Another case would be where the user is _only_ writing to the socket,
    as writes in AsyncSocket are also synchronous and wrap Socket.write directly.
